# askama-demo (trip-render)

simple little utility that takes a yaml file and renders out an html file for sharing with both other trip goers and family. 

## Notes

* hard codes input and output files. So you might want to make a folder per trip.
    * input: `./plan.yml`
    * output: `./simple.html`

* definite could improve the UX and the data modelling, but for now its mainly to make something useful while practicing with askama
